=====================================================
``pyDOE``: The experimental design package for python
=====================================================

**``pyDOE3`` is fork of ``pyDOE2`` which was a fork of ``pyDOE``**
As for ``pyDOE2`` wrt to ``pyDOE``, ``pyDOE3`` came to life to solve 
bugs and issues that remained unsolved in ``pyDOE2``.

The ``pyDOE3`` package is designed to help the 
**scientist, engineer, statistician,** etc., to construct appropriate 
**experimental designs**.

.. hint::
   All available designs can be accessed after a simple import statement::

    >>> from pyDOE3 import *
    
Capabilities
============

The package currently includes functions for creating designs for any 
number of factors:

- :ref:`Factorial Designs <factorial>`

  #. :ref:`General Full-Factorial <general_full_factorial>` (``fullfact``)

  #. :ref:`2-Level Full-Factorial <2_level_full_factorial>` (``ff2n``)

  #. :ref:`2-Level Fractional-Factorial <fractional_factorial>` (``fracfact``)

  #. :ref:`Plackett-Burman <plackett_burman>` (``pbdesign``)

- :ref:`Response-Surface Designs <response_surface>`

  #. :ref:`Box-Behnken <box_behnken>` (``bbdesign``)

  #. :ref:`Central-Composite <central_composite>` (``ccdesign``)

- :ref:`Randomized Designs <randomized>`

  #. :ref:`Latin-Hypercube <latin_hypercube>` (``lhs``)
