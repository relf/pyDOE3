The original Scilab code was converted to Python and packaged as PyDOE by:

- Copyright (c) 2014, Abraham D. Lee

This version provided Python users with factorial, fractional factorial, Plackett-Burman, Box-Behnken, central composite, and Latin-hypercube designs.

## PyDOE3
PyDOE3 is a fork of PyDOE2, created by:

- Copyright (c) 2023, Rémi Lafage

PyDOE3 added several new design families (optimal, sparse, Taguchi, sensitivity), fixed
long-standing bugs, and continued active development.
