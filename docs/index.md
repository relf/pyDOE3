# PyDOE3: An Experimental Design Package for Python

The `PyDOE3` package is designed to help the **scientist, engineer,
statistician,** etc., to construct appropriate 
**experimental designs**.

!!! tip "Quick Start"
    All available designs can be accessed after a simple import statement:

    ```python
    >>> from pyDOE3 import *
    ```

!!! warning "Deprecation Notice"
    **pyDOE3 will no longer be actively maintained and will be officially deprecated after this release.**

    The project originated as a continuation of PyDOE, but active development has
    since returned to the main **PyDOE** package. New features, bug fixes, and long-term
    support will be provided there.

    Users are encouraged to migrate to PyDOE:
