"""
This module implements the Korobov lattice generator for quasi-random sampling.

Korobov lattices are a subclass of rank-1 lattice rules used for generating
low-discrepancy sequences. These sequences are widely applied in quasi-Monte Carlo
methods, global optimization, and numerical integration of high-dimensional functions.

The construction uses modular arithmetic to build the generator vector using a
single integer parameter. When the number of points and the generator are coprime,
the resulting design exhibits Latin Hypercube-like properties with excellent
uniform coverage.

This implementation is based on a simplified rank-1 lattice formulation and
uses a linear-time algorithm.

    Generate a Korobov lattice design matrix.

    Korobov lattices form a class of low-discrepancy sequences for quasi-Monte Carlo
    methods. They are constructed using a generator vector derived from modular
    exponentiation of a single integer. The generated matrix represents samples in
    a uniform virtual grid.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_points : int
        Number of design points to generate.
    dimension : int
        Number of dimensions in the design space.
    generator_param : int, optional
        Generator parameter used in modular construction. If None, a random value
        in [2, `num_points`) is selected.

    Returns
    -------
    design : ndarray of shape (`num_points`, `dimension`)
        Integer-valued design matrix corresponding to bins on a modular grid.

    Notes
    -----
    The Korobov method is a special case of a rank-1 lattice. The generator vector
    is defined as:

        $$ z_i = (a^i) \mod N $$

    for i = 0 to d-1, where `a` is the generator_param and `N` is num_points.
    The resulting design has uniformity properties ideal for integration and
    high-dimensional optimization.

    To ensure good coverage, it's recommended that `gcd(generator_param, num_points) == 1`.
